### Advent of code 2024
---
I'm taking part in AOC this year (as I always do).
I want to learn golang and figured that this is likely a good method to do so.

For now, I only care about working code, it'll probably become closer to using best practices as the challenges progress.

Maybe I'll come back and clean it up later (I won't)

I'm usually a Java developer, so not having the insane amount of libraries is strange, This would usually be an import for me.
